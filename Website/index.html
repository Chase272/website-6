          <b>What is Black Fungus</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          Thousands of people in India who’ve battled COVID-19 are dying from a
          rare infection called black fungus.
          <br />
          <br />
          Mucormycosis, a dangerous infection known as black fungus, is
          threatening to disrupt India’s progress in ending the second wave of
          COVID-19. In an unfortunate form of double jeopardy, black fungus
          seems to pose the greatest threat to those who have recovered from the
          virus.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-container hidden" style="background-color: #285ef0;">
        <h2><strong>What is the disease?</strong></h2> <br>
        <p>Although rare, it is a serious infection. It is caused by a group of 
          moulds known as mucormycetes present naturally in the environment. It 
          mainly affects people who are on medication for health problems that 
          reduces their ability to fight environmental pathogens, say experts from 
          the Covid-19 task force task force.</p>  <br>

          <p>Sinuses or lungs of such individuals get affected after they inhale 
            fungal spores from the air. Doctors in some states have noted a rise in 
            cases of mucormycosis among people hospitalized or recovering from Covid 19, 
            with some requiring urgent surgery. Usually, mucormycetes does not pose a major 
            threat to those with a healthy immune system.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="last-info-container hidden">
        <h2 style="color:#1268b2;font-size: 25px;"><strong>What happens when one contracts it?</strong></h2> <br>

        <p>Warning signs include pain and redness around the eyes or nose, with fever, headache, 
          coughing, shortness of breath, bloody vomits, and altered mental status. According to 
          the advisory, infection with mucormycetes should be suspected when there is:</p> <br>

          <p><strong>*</strong> Sinusitis — nasal blockade or congestion, nasal discharge (blackish/bloody);<br>
            <strong>*</strong> Local pain on the cheek bone, one-sided facial pain, numbness or swelling;<br>
            <strong>*</strong> Blackish discoloration over bridge of nose/palate;<br>
            <strong>*</strong> Loosening of teeth, jaw involvement;<br>
            <strong>*</strong> Blurred or double vision with pain;<br> <br> <br>

            <p>Experts advise that one should not count all cases of blocked nose as cases of bacterial sinusitis, 
              particularly in the context of immunosuppression and/or Covid-19 patients on immunomodulators. Do not 
              hesitate to seek aggressive investigations for detecting fungal infection, they advise.</p>

      <p>While it is treated with antifungals, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/mucormycosis-and-covid-19-doctors-say-significant-challenge-symptoms-should-not-ignored-7293572/" >mucormycosis </a>
        may eventually require surgery. Doctors have said that it is of utmost importance to control diabetes, reduce steroid use, and discontinue immunomodulating drugs. 
         To maintain adequate systemic hydration, the treatment includes infusion of normal saline (IV) before infusion of amphotericin B and antifungal therapy, for 
         at least 4-6 weeks.</p> <br>

         <p>Experts in the task force have stressed the need to control hyperglycemia , and monitor blood glucose level after discharge following Covid-19 treatment, 
           and also in diabetics. One should use steroids 
           judiciously — correct timing, correct dose and duration are important.</p> <br>

           <p>Management of Covid patients with mucormycosis is a team effort involving microbiologists, internal medicine 
             specialists, intensivist neurologist, ENT specialists, ophthalmologists, dentists, surgeons (maxillofacial/plastic) and others.</p> <br>

             <h2  style="color:#1268b2;font-size: 25px;"><strong>How can one prevent it?</strong></h2> <br>

             <p>One should remember that it is a rare disease. However, some groups of people are more vulnerable than others. What predisposes patients is uncontrolled 
               diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression by steroids, 
               prolonged ICU stay, and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/coronavirus/serious-fungal-infection-seen-in-some-covid-patients-with-co-morbidities-expert-7291675/" class="">comorbidities </a>— 
               post transplant/malignancy, voriconazole therapy.</p> <br>

               <p>Experts advise that you use masks if you are visiting dusty construction sites. Wear shoes, long trousers, long-sleeved shirts and gloves while handling soil (gardening), 
                 moss or manure. Maintain personal hygiene including a thorough scrub bath.</p> <br>

                  <h2 style="color:#1268b2;font-size: 25px;"><strong>How frequently are cases being detected?</strong></h2> <br>

                  <p>While cases are on the rise, there has been no major outbreak. Niti Aayog member (health) Dr V K Paul said at a media briefing that there has 
                    been no major outbreak and they were monitoring cases being reported.</p> <br>

                  <p>In Maharashtra, Dr Tatyarao Lahane, head of the Directorate of Medical Education and Research, has said that cases of mucormycosis are on the rise.
                     “Traditionally we see a case every few months, usually in very poorly controlled diabetic and immunocompromised patients,” said Dr Parikshit Gogate, 
                     consulting ophthalmologist at Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune. “But in the past 2 to 3 weeks, I have seen almost 25-30 of them, mostly in Ruby Hall, some in D Y 
                     Patil Hospital.”</p> <br>

                  <p>Mucormycosis developing in post Covid-19 setting breaks the back of a patient’s family that is barely recovering from this viral infection , 
                    infectious diseases consultant in Pune Dr Rajeev Soman wrote in the Journal of Association of Physicians of India in January this year.</p> <br>

                  <p>Dr Soman is one of the expert members who drafted the advisory as part of the national Covid-19 task force. The also task force includes 
                    Dr Arunaloke Chakraborti, Head of the Department of Medical Microbiology, PGIMER, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/" class="">Chandigarh</a>; 
                    Dr Atul Patel, infectious diseases specialist, Ahmedabad; and several others.</p> <br> <br>

                  <p>Patients most vulnerable to mucormycosis are those who have been treated with steroids and other drugs for Covid 19 to reduce inflammation. Efforts
                     are underway to collect data for large studies being done by the Fungal Infections Study Forum and Clinical infectious Diseases Society, Dr Soman said.</p> <br><br>

        <h3 style="color:#1268b2;font-size: 25px;"> How Black fungus effects COVID patients?</h3> <br>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">Mucormycosis is a rare but serious fungal infection. While the cases of this infection were relatively less, the Covid-19 outbreak has 
          given a boost to the spread of this infection. It is commonly known as black fungus, the infection is now detected among Covid-19 patients across India. With a significant increase in fungal infection cases, 
          the government has mandated that all states have to report suspected and confirmed cases of mucormycosis to the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP). </p><br> <br>

          <p style="text-align:justify; ">Now let’s take a look at what this infection is and why it is caused more frequently among Covid-19 patients. The infection is rare, but once a person is infected, the fungus 
            manifests in the skin or can affect the brain or lungs, many cases of this infection have been reported in Covid-19 patients.</p> <br> <br> <br>


            <h3 style="color:#1268b2; font-size:25px;">Why is it occurring in COVID-19 patients!!</h3> <br> <br>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">Mucormycosis can occur after COVID-19 infection, whether during the hospital stay or a few weeks after discharge.</p> <br>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">The COVID-19 generates a sudden change in the interior environment of the host for the fungus, and the medical treatment administered unknowingly promotes 
              fungal development. COVID-19 causes harm to the airway mucosa and blood vessels. It also causes a rise in serum iron, which is required for the fungus to grow. Broad-spectrum antibiotics not only kill 
              potentially harmful bacteria but also beneficial commensals. Although antifungals such as Voriconazole prevent Aspergillosis, Mucor survives and grows due to a lack of resistance. Long-term ventilation decreases 
              immunity, and there is conjecture that the humidifier water that is delivered along with the oxygen transfers the fungus. </p> <br><br><br>
