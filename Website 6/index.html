          <b>What is Black Fungus</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          Thousands of people in India who’ve battled COVID-19 are dying from a
          rare infection called black fungus.
          <br />
          <br />
          Mucormycosis, a dangerous infection known as black fungus, is
          threatening to disrupt India’s progress in ending the second wave of
          COVID-19. In an unfortunate form of double jeopardy, black fungus
          seems to pose the greatest threat to those who have recovered from the
          virus.

          <h1 style="font-size: 50px"><strong>What is the disease?</strong></h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            Although rare, it is a serious infection. It is caused by a group of
            moulds known as mucormycetes present naturally in the environment.
            It mainly affects people who are on medication for health problems
            that reduces their ability to fight environmental pathogens, say
            experts from the Covid-19 task force task force.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Sinuses or lungs of such individuals get affected after they inhale
            fungal spores from the air. Doctors in some states have noted a rise
            in cases of mucormycosis among people hospitalized or recovering
            from Covid 19, with some requiring urgent surgery. Usually,
            mucormycetes does not pose a major threat to those with a healthy
            immune system.

          <strong>What happens when one contracts it?</strong>
        </h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          Warning signs include pain and redness around the eyes or nose, with
          fever, headache, coughing, shortness of breath, bloody vomits, and
          altered mental status. According to the advisory, infection with
          mucormycetes should be suspected when there is:
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <strong>*</strong> Sinusitis — nasal blockade or congestion, nasal
          discharge (blackish/bloody);<br />
          <strong>*</strong> Local pain on the cheek bone, one-sided facial
          pain, numbness or swelling;<br />
          <strong>*</strong> Blackish discoloration over bridge of
          nose/palate;<br />
          <strong>*</strong> Loosening of teeth, jaw involvement;<br />
          <strong>*</strong> Blurred or double vision with pain;<br />
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>

        <p>
          Experts advise that one should not count all cases of blocked nose as
          cases of bacterial sinusitis, particularly in the context of
          immunosuppression and/or Covid-19 patients on immunomodulators. Do not
          hesitate to seek aggressive investigations for detecting fungal
          infection, they advise.

          may eventually require surgery. Doctors have said that it is of utmost
          importance to control diabetes, reduce steroid use, and discontinue
          immunomodulating drugs. To maintain adequate systemic hydration, the
          treatment includes infusion of normal saline (IV) before infusion of
          amphotericin B and antifungal therapy, for at least 4-6 weeks.
        </p>

          Experts in the task force have stressed the need to control
          hyperglycemia , and monitor blood glucose level after discharge
          following Covid-19 treatment, and also in diabetics. One should use
          steroids judiciously — correct timing, correct dose and duration are
          important.

          One should remember that it is a rare disease. However, some groups of

          prolonged ICU stay, and

          personal hygiene including a thorough scrub bath.

          In Maharashtra, Dr Tatyarao Lahane, head of the Directorate of Medical
          Education and Research, has said that cases of mucormycosis are on the
          rise. “Traditionally we see a case every few months, usually in very
          poorly controlled diabetic and immunocompromised patients,” said Dr
          Parikshit Gogate, consulting ophthalmologist at Ruby Hall Clinic,
          Pune. “But in the past 2 to 3 weeks, I have seen almost 25-30 of them,
          mostly in Ruby Hall, some in D Y Patil Hospital.”
